# Wily-Wars-Randomizer

Discord server: https://discord.gg/CyerVeB2RP

Hello, and thank you for playing my Megaman: The Wily Wars randomizer.

Currently the default values it randomizes are:

Stages, Bosses, and Weapons Received

Doc Robot locations

Weaknesses

The stage that gives you the Rush Items or MM2 Items

If you would receive the Time Stopper weapon, who is affected by it. 
	For MM3 Mode(default) it is one boss and one Doc Robot.
	For MM2 Mode, it is two bosses.

Which weapon can break the walls normally broken by Crash Bomber or Hard Knuckle.
	Hyper Bomb and Time Stopper are the only two weapons incapable of breaking the crash/hard walls.

Which weapon can freeze the fire towers.
	Hyper Bomb, Crash Bomber, and Time Stopper are the only weapons not able to freeze the towers

- How to use the Randomizer:

In this update, you will no longer need to install Python to be able to run the randomizer.

1. Apply the .IPS patch to a Megaman: The Wily Wars European ROM. It can be either .bin or .md file types

Use Lunar IPS or another ips patching program to apply the patch.

If you want to keep a clean file, make a copy of the ROM file you want to apply the patch to.

If you aren't sure which ROM file you have, make sure it matches this MD5 checksum:

BB891AEC8A7DFE6164033F57AF2025BD

2. Run the Wily Wars Randomizer.exe file. There will be a few windows that pop up.

The first window will say Checking for Updates. It will check the GitHub for any new updates since the last time it was opened. If you don't have internet connectivity, you can skip this step.

If you do, a black window will briefly appear and then it will either tell you Updates Complete if there were any new updates or No Updates found if nothing new was found.

3. After that, a new window will appear to say that it is running the randomizer program. Then another window will appear that will allow you to select the different options on how you want to have your seed created.

This window will have:

Randomize Bosses Only

Randomize Weapons Only

Randomize Stages Only

Additionally it will also have 4 different modes of randomization:

Random Damage from Bosses

Random Weapon Ammo Usage

Megaman 2 Mode

Randomize Wily Stages


As well as 3 options to change different modifications of the randomized seed:

Skip Wily Castle Intro

Disable Lives Refill

Disable Time Stopper Mod

If none of these are checked, it will assume the default randomization method as described in the beginning.

You can create multiple different seeds with any options selected by increasing the number of seeds to generate.

Each option has a tooltip if you hover over the option that gives you a brief description of the option.

Use the program to browse to the file you just patched. When ready, click Randomize! When finished, click the X button to close the window.

This will create a new directory in the scripts folder named Output. This is where any seeds you have generated will be as well as spoiler logs that tell you what was selected.

4. The last window that will appear will tell you that it will run the Logic script. This script is vital for the randomizer to work properly as it contextualizes the information from the previous step so that everything works properly.

It will ask for a ROM file to open. Load the ROM file generated from the previous step and click Open.

Once it's done, it will state READY. Then a new prompt will appear asking if there are any other ROMs to run this script for. If there are, click Yes and it will prompt for more files to open. If not, click No and that will be the end.

You can now play the randomized ROM. Please enjoy playing the randomizer.
