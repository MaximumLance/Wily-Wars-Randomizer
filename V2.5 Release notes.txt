Version 2.5 Release Notes:
August 8th, 2021

New Mode added: Randomize Wily Stages
New QoL feature: Skip Wily Castle Intro

Patch:
- Added compatibilty to the randomizer to be able to load randomly generated stage values once the Wily stages are available

- Cutman Arena oversight fix: Parts of the ceiling tiles aren't programmed to have collision. I've changed the arena to make sure all of the ceiling is solid.

- Restored Airman, Crashman, and Quickman arenas. These were necessary if you were playing in Megaman 3 and once you defeated the boss, the Get Weapon animation would have Megaman loop around the screen for lengthy periods of time. However I recently found what conditions this animation would trigger and have made it so the animation is skipped during these stages as well as non MM3 Wily stages.

- Fixed Copy Robot attack routines: Normally if you equipped a non MM1 weapon the game would crash because Copy Robot was never intended to be able to use non-MM1 weapons and would look to jump at data that was unrelated. Now Copy Robot will either use a MM1 weapon similar to yours or use an weapon that would be the opposite of what you are using (ex. Equips Fire Storm if you have Leaf Shield equipped).

- MM1 Wily 1 stage changes: Your buster now breaks Guts Blocks and will freeze the Fire Pillars. Additionally I have removed the 1st column in the room near the boss(Magnet beam check room) so that MM2 Items and Rush can be used to get to the other side.

-Optimized MM3 Dr. Light cutscene text: In the cutscene before the Wily Castle Intro, the original NES version had a line break for the word "element" since it wouldn't fit on the previous line. I changed it to a space because the word can and it cut an unnecessary screen of text. I also did the same to the word "Gamma" at the end since it also would fit on the line.

Logic:
-If you are in Megaman 3 and have random Wily stages enabled, if one of the Wily Stages is MM2 Wily 1 or MM2 Wily 2, small changes to the stage will be made to allow easier navigation. For the former, the ladder section near the end has a platform so you can call Rush Jet and in the latter, part of the pillar in the hallway where the moles and ceiling traps are has been removed.

- Fixed an issue where values would be incorrectly written for Bombman and Elecman.

- Rewrote the Doc Robot integrity checking script to help resolve rare cases where the seed was unable to be finished.

- Fixed an issue where the values for Time Stopper was not being written to the correct address. Additionally resolved an issue where if random bosses and weapons, who was weak to Time Stopper would only affect one boss instead of two different ones.

- Found and resolved an issue where some times Snakeman was not put in his refight capsule if he was a boss.

- If a user wanted just random bosses and selected to have random ammo values, the ammo values would not be written correctly to ROM 

- Redesigned the script that handles which boss gives which Item after defeat

Thank you everyone for playing my randomizer so far, I intend to continue working on it to make it the best I can.
