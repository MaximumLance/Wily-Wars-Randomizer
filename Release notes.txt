Version 3 Release Notes:
December 13, 2024

I can't believe it's been over 3 years since the last update.

In this update, I changed how the user interacts with the randomizer. You shouldn't be required to install python anymore. Instead, everything now is linked to one simple exe file that handles everything.

I also made a lot of changes to the randomizer itself:

Randomizer:
- Changed the way weaknesses are chosen and assigned.
Previously damage values were randomly chosen between 1,2,4,7, or (reflected)

Now everything will do atleast 1-2 damage with the weakness doing 4-7 damage, with some exceptions

The bosses have a primary weakness(5-7 damage) and a secondary weakness(4 damage)

The robot masters and Doc Robots have a weakness chain to follow now.

- Buster damage against bosses is now randomized. It will either do 1 or 2 damage.

- Randomized Ammo Consumption is now going to have more options. Originally it was only a few numbers with large changes, but I have implemented several more values for more randomness. The new values start from 1/4 and scale up to 3 1/2

- Each option now has a tooltip if you hover over the option that gives you a brief description of the option.

Patch:
- Time Stopper received a mod in which instead of draining the whole energy bar, it will last for
only 3 seconds. This part can be undone by selecting the Disable Time Stopper Mod while making a seed.

I also lowered the ammo consumption to 1/2. This applies even in randomized ammo consumption.

It will also do more damage over time - about 30% faster at draining the opponent's health.

Currently if you are in MM2, it affects 2 different bosses. In MM3, it affects 1 boss and 1 Doc Robot.

- Lives will be refilled to 2 if you have less than 2 in between stages, except for the Wily Stages. This can also be disabled by selecting Disable Lives Refill.

- Small health and weapon energy items give you twice as much energy now - 4 instead of 2.

- Reduced time in MM3 for Stage end sequence to finish

- Removed Guts Blocks from all Wily Stages except for MM1 Wily 3. They cannot be destroyed.
Also, Removed a guts block from Elecman's stage that was blocking one of the paths near the top of the tower.

- Fire Towers now freeze from a single random weapon. They won't freeze for the Time Stopper, Hyper Bomb, or Crash Bomber.

- Redesigned MM1 Wily 1 Entrance to have weapon energy drops to compensate for the different modes and rotation in randomized wily stages

- Reworked the Show Hidden Skull code to be more accurate.

- Doc Robots can be freely interchanged now. Previously they were set in two groups based on what part of the level they were in. Group A are the ones that you encounter first while Group B is the ones you encounter second. If you mixed these up, the level could either end early or not end at all.

I've made it so no matter which one is where, the level will still continue or end as normal.

- Weapon Ammo consumption has been changed for a few weapons:

Reduced:
Hyper Bomb: Normal: 2 New: 1
Atomic Heat: Normal: 1:6:10 New: 1.25:3:6
Time Stopper: Normal: 1 New: .5
Crash Bomber: Normal: 4 New: 3
Magnet Missile: Normal: 2 New: 1.5
Hard Knuckle: Normal: 2 New: 1.5

Increased:
Thunder Beam: Normal: 1 New: 2
Fire Storm: Normal: 1 New: 2
Quick Boomerang: Normal: .125 New: .25
Metal Blade: Normal: .25  New: 1 
Spark Shot: Normal: 1/2 New: 1 

- Updated Copyright Year on Main Menu

Logic:

- Default mode is now Random Bosses and Weapons.

- If you encounter Geminiman in Elecman's stage, the arena will be now flat.

- In Geminiman 2 Stage, the arena will be flat based on which Doc Robot will be there.



As always, your time spent playing and feedback given has been appreciated.
