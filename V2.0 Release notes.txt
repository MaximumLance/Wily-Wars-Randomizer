Version 2.0 Release Notes:
May 30th, 2021

Much of what I've done is made changes to the Patch, Randomizer, and Logic Script to where Megaman 2 can be played.

The most notable changes I made to Megaman 2 were touching up the Get Weapon palettes, Alien takes 2 damage from a weakness and also other weapons will deflect off it instead of completely healing it, a Yashichi was also added in Megaman 2's Wily 6 Stage, and an e-tank was added in Wily 5.

I did make a few improvements to the logic script as well, most notably, Random Ammo Usage now properly affects Atomic Heat. Before it only affected the base level.

Speaking of, I decided to remove the most efficient and least efficient Ammo usage values from the Randomizer. The extremes of either side of the scale were just too much.

Thank you everyone for playing my randomizer so far, I intend to continue working on it to make it the best I can.
